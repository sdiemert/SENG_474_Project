ABSENCE OF VENTRICULAR PACING WAS OBSERVED IN BIPOLAR AND UNIPOLAR CONFIGURATION. THE VENTRICULAR LEAD WAS CHECKED AND THE X-RAY DIDN'T REVEAL ANY MOVEMENT OF THE VENTRICULAR LEAD.

THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS FAILURE IS DUE TO THE LIGHT EXTENSION ARM CLEVIS RETAINING PIN NOT BEING FULLY ENGAGED IN THE HINGE.

THE LIGHT IS MAINTAINED INTERNALLY BY THE HOSPITAL'S FACILITY MANAGEMENT AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENTS. THE STERIS MAINTENANCE AND OPERATOR MANUALS BOTH IDENTIFY AND REQUIRE PM CHECKS TO ENSURE RETAINING PIN SECUREMENT. THE PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE CHART, P 4-2, SEC 4.0 OF TABLE 4-1, REQUIRES RETAINING PIN INSPECTION AT A MINIMUM OF ONE TIME PER YEAR. THE ROUTINE INSPECTION SECTION 4.2, ITEM 2 OF THE MAINTENANCE MANUAL, REQUIRES INSPECTION OF THE CEILING AND WALL FIXTURES TO ENSURE THEY ARE \"TIGHT AND PROPERLY SUPPORTED.\" ADDITIONALLY, THE STERIS TECHNICIAN HAS INSPECTED ALL EXAM 10 LIGHTS AT THIS FACILITY AND IDENTIFIED THE OTHER LIGHTS WITH CLEVIS RETAINING PINS NOT BEING FULLY ENGAGED.

KINKING OF THE COIL DISTAL TO THE HEADPIECE WAS NOTED. NO OTHER OBVIOUS ANOMALIES WERE NOTED. A NEW SYRINGE FILLED WITH TAP WATER WAS USED TO PRESSURIZE THE UNIT. THE SYSTEM PRESSURE WAS MONITORED USING A CALIBRATED PRESSURE TRANSDUCER. AIR WAS PURGED FROM THE SYRINGE/PRESSURE TRANSDUCER PRIOR TO USE. THE UNIT WAS PRESSURIZED TO THE TOP OF THE ORANGE ZONE (PRESSURE READING OF 12 PSI). NO FLOW NOTED OUT OF THE PURGE HOLE, PRESSURE DECAY NOTED ON THE PRESSURE TRANSDUCER. PRESSURE WAS THEN INCREASED TO THE MIDDLE OF THE ZONE BETWEEN ORANGE AND BLUE (PRESSURE READING OF 46 PSI). NO FLOW NOTED OUT OF THE PURGE HOLE, NO SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE DECAY NOTED ON THE PRESSURE TRANSDUCER. CONTINUED TO INCREASE PRESSURE AND IMMEDIATELY FLUID WAS NOTED COMING RAPIDLY OUT OF THE PURGE HOLE. STOPPED INCREASING PRESSURE. PRESSURE RAPIDLY DROPPED TO ABOUT 5 PSI. STARTED TO INCREASE PRESSURE TO TAKE THE UNIT TO THE BLUE ZONE (PURGE PRESSURE). AT ABOUT 25 PSI RAPID FLUID LOSS WAS NOTED. CONTINUE TO INCREASE PRESSURE TOWARDS THE BLUE ZONE. AT AROUND 76 PSI A LARGE STREAM OF FLUID WAS OBSERVED COMING OUT OF THE PURGE HOLE. AT THIS POINT A PARTICLE LODGES IN THE PURGE HOLE AND BLOCKS THE PURGE HOLE. VERY SLOW DECAY AND LOW FLUID LEAKAGE NOTED COMING OUT OF THE PURGE HOLE (PRESSURE READING STEADY AT 64 PSI). THE UNIT WAS THEN PRESSURIZED TO MID-POINT OF THE BLUE ZONE (READING OF 120 PSI). NO APPRECIABLE FLUID LEAKAGE NOTED OUT OF THE PURGE HOLE, NO SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE DECAY. IN AN ATTEMPT TO TRY AND REMOVE THE PARTICLE FROM THE PURGE HOLE, THE UNIT WAS DISCONNECTED FROM THE SYRINGE/PRESSURE TRANSDUCER AND A 1CC SYRINGE WAS USED TO PULL VACUUM. FLUID IS REMOVED FROM THE LUMEN OF THE DEVICE. NOT CLEAR IF ALL FLUID IS REMOVED. THE UNIT WAS RECONNECTED TO THE SYRINGE/PRESSURE TRANSDUCER. THE PRESSURE WAS SLOWLY INCREASED ONCE MORE. AT THE TOP OF THE ORANGE ZONE FLUID IS NOTED COMING OUT OF THE PURGE HOLE (READING OF 14 PSI). STARTED TO INCREASE PRESSURE TO TAKE THE UNIT TO THE BLUE ZONE (PURGE PRESSURE).

AFTER REMOVING THE DEVICE FROM THE PATIENT, EXTRAVASATION OF CONTRAST WAS NOTED NEAR THE ANEURYSM INDICATING AN ADDITIONAL SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE; IT APPEARED TO BE FROM THE ANEURYSM, BUT COULD NOT BE DEFINITIVELY DETERMINED. ANOTHER 5X10 GALAXY COMPLEX FILL COIL WAS QUICKLY PLACED IN THE ANEURYSM WITHOUT ANY DIFFICULTY WITH PLACEMENT OR DETACHMENT WITH THE SAME SYRINGE USED WITH THE FIRST COIL. THE PATIENT DID UNDERGO A SUBSEQUENT CRANIOTOMY FOR HEMATOMA REMOVAL, BUT THE PHYSICIAN SAID THE PATIENT WOULD HAVE NEEDED ONE ANYWAY. AFTERWARDS, THE PATIENT WAS ON A VENTILATOR IN THE ICU. THE PHYSICIAN DID NOT FEEL THAT THE COIL REMOVAL CONTRIBUTED TO ANY WORSENING SYMPTOMS OF THIS PATIENT. THE ANEURYSM MEASURED 5MM X 4.5MM X 5MM. THE 5X10 GALAXY WAS THE FIRST COIL PLACED AND WAS PREPPED AND DELIVERED PER THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU). THE LUER VALVE WAS NOT UTILIZED WITH THE COIL DELIVERY SYSTEM. AFTER BEING SATISFIED WITH THE PLACEMENT OF THE COIL, THE GALAXY DETACHMENT SEQUENCE WAS INITIATED WITH THE TRUFILL DCS SYRINGE II. AFTER TAKING THE SYRINGE TO GREEN (THIRD POSITION), A RAPID PRESSURE DECAY WAS NOT NOTED (WHICH INDICATES COIL DETACHMENT). THEN, THE SYRINGE WAS TAKEN TO RED ZONE (FOURTH POSITION), BUT THERE WAS NO APPRECIABLE RAPID PRESSURE DECAY. THE PREVIOUS SEQUENCE WAS REPEATED (TAKING THE SYRINGE TO THE 3RD, AND THEN TO 4TH POSITION), STILL NO DECAY WAS NOTED. THE COIL WAS THEN READJUSTED FORWARD AND BACKWARD WHILE MAINTAINING PRESSURE IN THE SYRINGE; STILL NO PRESSURE DECAY NOTED. THE CYCLE WAS REPEATED FIVE TIMES WITH STILL NO DECAY/DETACHMENT NOTED. AT THIS TIME, IT WAS DETERMINED TO REMOVE THE COIL FROM THE MICROCATHETER WHICH WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITH NO DIFFICULTY. HOWEVER, AFTER THIS, THE EXTRAVASATION WAS NOTED WHICH WAS TREATED WITH PLACEMENT OF ANOTHER GALAXY COIL. NO LEAKS WERE NOTED IN ANY SECTION OF THE CONNECTIONS WITH THE COIL HUB, SYRINGE, GALAXY LUER VALVE, OR RHVS. A CONSTANT AND DEDICATED SALINE SOURCE WAS UTILIZED AT ALL TIMES. DURING POSITIONING, CONSTANT FLUOROSCOPY WAS PERFORMED AT ALL TIMES. A NON-STERILE ORBIT GALAXY TIGHT DISTAL LOOP COMPLEX FILL COIL 5 X 10 WAS RECEIVED COILED INSIDE OF A POUCH. HYPOTUBE WAS INSPECTED AND NO DAMAGES WERE NOTED ON IT. THE INTRODUCER WAS RECEIVED ZIPPED WITHOUT DAMAGE. THE SUPPORT COIL, GRIPPER AND EMBOLIC COIL WERE FOUND INSIDE OF THE INTRODUCER WITHOUT DAMAGE. THE GRIPPER AND THE EMBOLIC COIL WERE INSPECTED UNDER MICROSCOPE; THE PURGE HOLE OF THE GRIPPER WAS FOUND BLOCKED BY A PARTICLE, WHICH APPEARS TO BE DRIED BLOOD. THE EMBOLIC COIL WAS STILL ATTACHED TO THE GRIPPER WITHOUT DAMAGE. AN ATTEMPT TO PURGE THE UNIT IN THE BLUE ZONE USING A LAB SAMPLE SYRINGE (635-002) WAS PERFORMED BUT IT WAS NOT SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED. THE FAILURE TO PURGE APPARENTLY WAS RELATED TO THE PARTICLE THAT APPEARS TO BE DRIED BLOOD THAT WAS NOTED ON THE PURGE HOLE. WHEN THE PRESSURE WAS INCREASED PAST THE BLUE ZONE, THE PARTICLE WAS REMOVED FROM THE PURGE HOLE AND THE PURGING OF THE UNIT WAS PERFORMED WITHOUT ANY ANOMALIES. FUNCTIONAL TESTING FOR COIL DETACHMENT WAS THEN PREFORMED WITH INCREASING THE PRESSURE TO THE GREEN ZONE AND THE EMBOLIC COIL WAS DETACHED WITHOUT ANY DIFFICULTY. A REVIEW OF THE MANUFACTURING DOCUMENTATION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOT PRESENTED NO ISSUES DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS THAT CAN BE RELATED TO THE REPORTED COMPLAINT. VESSEL DISSECTION, PERFORATION, RUPTURE AND HEMORRHAGE ARE KNOWN POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS SPECIFIC TO EMBOLIZATION PROCEDURES AS OUTLINED IN THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE. ARTERIAL EMBOLIZATION PROCEDURES ARE PERFORMED IN VESSELS WITH EXISTING ANEURISMS AND KNOWN VESSEL WALL WEAKNESS. REVIEW OF THE INFORMATION SUGGESTS THAT VESSEL AND PROCEDURAL ISSUES MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED ARTERIAL RUPTURE. WITH FUNCTIONAL TESTING, THE REPORTED FAILURE TO DETACH WAS NOT CONFIRMED AS THE EMBOLIC COIL WAS SUCCESSFULLY DETACHED. WITH REVIEW OF THE ANALYSIS AND THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORDS, THERE IS NO INDICATION OF ANY RELATIONSHIP TO THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. ADDITIONALLY, INSPECTIONS ARE IN PLACE TO PREVENT THIS TYPE OF FAILURE FROM LEAVING THE FACILITY. THE CAUSE OF THE REPORTED FAILURE TO DETACH COULD NOT BE CONCLUSIVELY DETERMINED. VIA THE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS AN INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN OPENED TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE AND ADDRESS COMPLAINTS OF DETACHMENT DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ORBIT GALAXY. ACTION WAS OPENED TO ADDRESS GALAXY FAILURE TO DETACH COMPLAINTS.",

THIS REGISTRY IS A PATIENT TRACKING MECHANISM FOR SERIALIZED EDWARDS IMPLANTABLE DEVICES (BIOPROSTHETIC HEART VALVES AND ANNULOPLASTY RINGS), RATHER THAN A TRUE POST-MARKET SURVEILLANCE REGISTRY. THROUGH THE REGISTRY, EDWARDS IS NOTIFIED WHEN THESE DEVICES ARE IMPLANTED. IN ADDITION, PATIENT AND/OR DEVICE STATUS MAY BE REPORTED TO THE REGISTRY VIA THE IMPLANTATION DATA CARDS. THE INFORMATION IS RECEIVED FROM VARIOUS SOURCES (E.G. SURGEON, HOSPITAL, AND PATIENT FAMILY MEMBERS) AND IS NOT RECEIVED IN THE FORM OF A CONVENTIONAL \"CUSTOMER COMPLAINT\". THE INFORMATION REPORTED MAY OR MAY NOT BE RELATED TO THE EDWARDS DEVICE. IN THIS CASE, IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE DEVICE WAS EXPLANTED AFTER AN IMPLANT DURATION OF APPROXIMATELY 4 YEARS AND 8 MONTHS. THROUGH FOLLOW-UP WITH THE HEALTH-CARE PROVIDER, IT WAS LEARNED THAT THE DEVICE WAS EXPLANTED DUE TO MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY. ACCORDING TO THE OPERATIVE REPORT: \"THIS PATIENT IS A (B)(6) YEAR-OLD WHO INITIALLY PRESENTED IN 2006 WITH ACUTE PAPILLARY MUSCLE RUPTURE AND ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION REQUIRING EMERGING MITRAL VALVE REPAIR AND CORONARY GRAFTING TIMES ONE. SHE DEVELOPED RECURRENT SHORTNESS OF BREATH AND FATIGUE AND WAS FOUND TO HAVE RECURRENT 4+ INSUFFICIENCY WITH MARKED PULMONARY HYPERTENSION...WE THEN ENTERED THE LEFT ATRIUM DIRECTLY AND EXPOSED THE MITRAL VALVE, WHICH WAS SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT DUE TO THE SIZE OF THE ATRIUM AND THE DEPTH OF THE VALVE. THE VALVE WAS THEN ELEVATED INTO POSITION. THE PREVIOUSLY PLACED CIRCUMFERENTIAL RING WAS IN A GOOD POSITION AND WELL ENDOTHELIALIZED AND THEN CAREFULLY EXCISED. ONCE THE RING HAS BEEN EXCISED, WE THEN PULLED UP THE ANTERIOR LEAF OF THE MITRAL VALVE, SACRIFICING THIS LEAFLET AND REMOVING THE PREVIOUSLY PLACED GORE-TEX CORD. THE POSTERIOR LEAFLET AND ITS SUBVALVULAR STRUCTURES WERE ENTIRELY SPARED. WE THEN PLACED THE CIRCUMFERENTIAL EVERTING 2-0 SUTURES OF THE MITRAL ANNULUS BRINGING THE NEEDLE ENDS UP TO THE SEWING RING OF THE CHOSEN 29MM PERICARDIAL VALVE [EDWARDS VALVE]. THE VALVE WAS THEN LOWERED NICELY INTO POSITION.\" FURTHERMORE, THE SURGEON HAS NOTED THAT THE REASON FOR EXPLANTING THE VALVE WAS NOT RELATED TO A DEVICE MALFUNCTION; THE REASON WAS PATIENT RELATED.",

EVALUATION SUMMARY: EVALUATION OF THE RETURNED XIENCE V STENT DELIVERY SYSTEM (SDS) FOUND BLOOD IN THE GUIDE WIRE LUMEN AND ON THE BALLOON AND CONTRAST IN THE INFLATION LUMEN. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH PREPARATION, A GUIDE WIRE INSERTED INTO THE LUMEN, AND THE SDS ADVANCED INTO THE BODY. THE STENT IMPLANT WAS STATIONARY ON THE TIGHTLY FOLDED BALLOON BETWEEN THE MARKERS. ANALYSIS ALSO NOTED THE PROXIMAL END OF THE STENT IMPLANT WAS STRETCHED DISTALLY. THE INABILITY TO CROSS A LESION CAN BE AFFECTED BY NUMEROUS FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PATIENT ANATOMICAL MORPHOLOGY, PATIENT DISEASE STATE, PRE-DILATATION STRATEGY, DEVICE PLACEMENT TECHNIQUE, DEVICE SIZE SELECTION, ACCESSORY DEVICE SUPPORT, AND/OR PREVIOUSLY IMPLANTED STENTS. THE TIP LENGTH AND STENT OUTER DIAMETERS WERE MEASURED AND MET MANUFACTURING CRITERIA. IN THIS CASE, THE PATIENT ANATOMY WAS HEAVILY CALCIFIED AND TORTUOUS, IN ADDITION TO THE ATTEMPT TO CROSS THE PREVIOUSLY IMPLANTED STENT, ALL OF WHICH LIKELY CONTRIBUTED TO THE FAILURE TO ADVANCE AND NOTED STENT DAMAGE. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE XIENCE V INSTRUCTION FOR USE (IFU) CAUTIONS THAT IN TREATING MORE THAN ONE VESSEL PER CORONARY ARTERY WITH THESE STENTS, PLACE THE STENT IN THE DISTAL LESION BEFORE THE PROXIMAL LESION IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE DISLODGEMENT RISK INCURRED BY TRAVERSING THROUGH DEPLOYED STENTS. FURTHER, IT WAS REPORTED THAT RESISTANCE WAS MET DURING REMOVAL AS THE STENT INTERACTED WITH THE PREVIOUSLY IMPLANTED STENT. THE IFU ALSO INSTRUCTS THE USER THAT SHOULD ANY RESISTANCE BE FELT AT ANY TIME DURING CORONARY STENT SYSTEM WITHDRAWAL, THE STENT DELIVERY SYSTEM AND GUIDING CATHETER SHOULD BE REMOVED AS A SINGLE UNIT. SINCE THERE WAS NO REPORT OF ANY DAMAGE OBSERVED TO THE SDS OR STENT IMPLANT PRIOR TO THE PROCEDURE, THIS MAY SUGGEST THAT A PRODUCT DEFICIENCY DID NOT CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED DIFFICULTIES. IN THIS INSTANCE, THE DAMAGED STENT LIKELY BECAME ENTANGLED WITH THE PREVIOUSLY IMPLANTED STENT DURING THE ATTEMPT TO WITHDRAW THE SDS AND THUS CONTRIBUTING TO THE REPORTED RESISTANCE. TO ENSURE THIS TYPE OF EVENT IS NOT THE RESULT OF A PRODUCT DEFICIENCY, ALL SDS ARE 100% VISUALLY INSPECTED ONLINE FOR STENT DAMAGE, INCLUDING AT THE POINT THAT THE PROTECTIVE SHEATH IS PLACED ON THE STENT. A REVIEW OF THE PRODUCT MANUFACTURING RECORDS DID NOT REVEAL ANY NONCONFORMING MATERIAL RECORDS (NCMR) ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOT THAT COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS REPORT AND THERE HAVE BEEN NO RELATED INCIDENTS REPORTED FOR THIS LOT. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THERE ARE NO LOT SPECIFIC PRODUCT QUALITY DEFICIENCIES. IN THIS CASE, THE FAILURE TO CROSS, STENT DAMAGE, AND DIFFICULTY REMOVING THE SDS APPEAR TO BE RELATED TO OPERATIONAL CONTEXT. THE PROFILE DIMENSIONS ON ALL STENT DELIVERY SYSTEMS ARE CONFIRMED BY VISUAL AND DIMENSIONAL CHECKS ON THE MANUFACTURING LINE BEFORE RELEASE. ADDITIONALLY, ALL STENT DELIVERY SYSTEMS ARE 100% VISUALLY INSPECTED ONLINE FOR STENT DAMAGE.",

THE STENT IMPLANT WAS STATIONARY ON THE BALLOON BETWEEN THE MARKERS. THERE WAS NO DAMAGE NOTED TO THE STENT IMPLANT. THE BALLOON WAS TIGHTLY FOLDED. THE BALLOON WAS SEPARATED AT THE PROXIMAL SEAL. THE MATERIAL AT THE DISTAL END OF THE SEPARATION WAS JAGGED. THE INNER MEMBER WAS SEPARATED 1.6 CM DISTAL TO THE GUIDE WIRE EXIT NOTCH. THERE WAS A KINK IN THE INFLATION LUMEN 3.9 CM DISTAL TO THE GUIDE WIRE EXIT NOTCH. THE INNER MEMBER WAS SMASHED 1.5 CM PROXIMAL TO THE PROXIMAL SEAL FOR A LENGTH OF 4 MM. THERE WAS A KINK IN THE HYPOTUBE 4.5 CM DISTAL TO THE STRAIN RELIEF TUBING. THERE WAS NO OTHER DAMAGE NOTED TO THE SDS. PRODUCT PERFORMANCE ENGINEERING REVIEWED THE INCIDENT INFORMATION AND THE RETURNED DEVICE ANALYSIS. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE RX ZETA BROKE AS THE SDS WAS ADVANCED ONTO THE GUIDE WIRE. ANALYSIS OF THE RETURNED DEVICE CONFIRMED THAT THE SDS WAS SEPARATED INTO TWO PIECES; THE OUTER MEMBER WAS SEPARATED AT THE PROXIMAL BALLOON SEAL WHILE THE INNER MEMBER WAS SEPARATED 1.6 CM DISTAL TO THE GUIDE WIRE EXIT NOTCH. BOTH OF THE SEPARATIONS APPEARED SLIGHTLY STRETCHED AND JAGGED, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT FORCE WAS USED TO PULL THE DEVICE APART. THERE WAS NO BLOOD OBSERVED ON THE RETURNED DEVICE, WHICH SUGGESTS IT WAS NOT USED IN THE PATIENT ANATOMY, THOUGH THE CONTRAST IN THE BALLOON SUGGESTS THAT THE SDS WAS PREPARED WITH POSITIVE PRESSURE AT SOME POINT. THE INNER MEMBER WAS FOUND TO BE SMASHED PROXIMAL TO THE PROXIMAL BALLOON SEAL, WHICH CAN BE THE RESULT OF MISHANDLING EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER THE SEPARATION OCCURRED, THOUGH THIS COULD NOT BE CONFIRMED. THERE WERE ALSO TWO KINKS NOTED IN THE RETURNED SDS, THOUGH BOTH WERE ONLY IN THE OUTER MEMBER, AND THUS WOULD NOT HAVE AFFECTED ANY DIFFICULTIES INSERTING THE DEVICE OVER THE GUIDE WIRE. BASED ON THE INCIDENT INFORMATION AND RETURNED DEVICE ANALYSIS, IT APPEARS THAT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE SEPARATION WAS FORCE APPLIED TO THE RX ZETA, AND THUS THE OPERATIONAL CONTEXT OF THE DEVICE. A REVIEW OF THE FINISHED DEVICE LOT HISTORY RECORD DID NOT REVEAL ANY NON-CONFORMING MATERIAL REPORTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOT. THIS MDR IS CONSIDERED CLOSED BY THE PRODUCT PERFORMANCE GROUP.",

IT WAS REPORTED THAT 336 DAYS AFTER IMPLANTATION OF 2.5X16MM, 2.5X24MM, AND 2.5X24MM TAXUS EXPRESS2 DRUG ELUTING STENTS, IN-STENT RESTENOSES OCCURRED. DURING THE INITIAL PROCEDURE, THE TARGET LESIONS WERE LOCATED  IN THE MID AND PROXIMAL LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING (LAD) AND THE OSTIAL 1ST DIAGONAL (D1) ARTERIES. PRE-INTERVENTION STENOSIS OF 80-90% AND 90% RESPECTIVELY, WERE REPORTED. AN ATTEMPT TO DILATE THE LAD WITH A 2.5MM BALLOON (LENGTH AND TYPE WERE NOT REPORTED) WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. THE \"CALCIFIED, MID LAD\" LESION WAS SUCCESSFULLY CROSSED WITH A 1.5MM BALLOON AND ANGIOPLASTY WAS PERFORMED. A \"SIGNIFICANT ECCENTRIC LESION\" WAS NOTED AT THE ORIGIN OF D1 AND \"IMMEDIATELY PROXIMAL TO D1 WITHIN THE LAD.\" A 2.5MM BALLOON WAS USED TO ANGIOPLASTY THIS AREA. THE D1 ARTERY WAS THEN STENTED WITH A 2.5X16MM TAXUS STENT. SUBSEQUENTLY,  \"TANDEM\" STENTING OF THE MID AND PROXIMAL LAD WAS PERFORMED INITIALLY USING TWO 2.5X24MM TAXUS STENTS, FOLLOWED BY A 3.0X32MM TAXUS STENT, AND A 3.0X16MM TAXUS STENT. KISSING BALLOON DILATATION WAS PERFORMED USING A 2.5MM BALLOON TO POST-DILATE D1 AND THE LAD AT THE BIFURCATION. A POST-INTERVENTION RESIDUAL STENOSIS OF 0% WAS NOTED FOR THE LAD AND D1. TIMI III FLOW WAS REPORTED IN THE LAD. THE PROCEDURE WAS NOTED TO BE \"SUCCESSFUL.\" THE \"PATIENT DID WELL WITHOUT COMPLICATIONS.\" THE PATIENT PRESENTED 336 DAYS AFTER THE INITIAL PROCEDURE WITH A 90% \"FOCAL\" IN-STENT RESTENOSIS IN THE OSTIAL D1 ARTERY AND AN 80% IN-STENT RESTENOSIS IN THE MID LAD. IT WAS NOT REPORTED THAT THE LAD WAS PRE-DILATED. A 3.0X20MM TAXUS STENT WAS DEPLOYED AT 20 ATM IN THE MID LAD. PERCUTANEOUS TRANSLUMINAL CORONARY ANGIOPLASTY WAS PERFORMED ON D1 USING A 2.5X14MM BALLOON (TYPE NOT SPECIFIED). KISSING BALLOON DILATATION WAS PERFORMED ON D1 AND THE LAD WITH THE 2.5X14MM BALLOON.

THE BALLOON WAS TIGHTLY FOLDED. THE PROTECTIVE SHEATH AND STYLET WERE RETURNED COVERING THE BALLOON. THE BALLOON CATHETER WAS RETURNED WITH A SEPARATION OF THE LAP JOINT, 4.4CM PROXIMAL TO THE GUIDE WIRE EXIT NOTCH. THERE WAS ADHESIVE VISIBLE ON THE DISTAL SHAFT AND INSIDE THE PROXIMAL PORTION OF THE SEPARATION. THE MATERIAL WAS NOT STRETCHED OR JAGGED. THERE WAS NO OTHER DAMAGE NOTED TO THE BALLOON CATHETER. PRODUCT PERFORMANCE ENGINEERING REVIEWED THE INCIDENT INFO AND THE RETURNED DEVICE ANALYSIS. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE SOFT TIP OF THE CATHETER WAS FOUND TO BE SEPARATED WHEN THE DEVICE WAS REMOVED FROM THE PACKAGING. HOWEVER, ANALYSIS OF THE RETURNED DEVICE FOUND THAT WHILE THE TIP OF THE DEVICE WAS NOT DAMAGED, THE SHAFT WAS SEPARATED AT THE LAP JOINT. ALTHOUGH THERE WAS ADHESIVE VISIBLE AT THE JOINT, THERE WAS NO STRETCHING OR JAGGED EDGES, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THE TWO PARTS MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENTLY ADHERED DURING MANUFACTURING. IT IS POSSIBLE THA THE JOINT DID NOT RECEIVE ADEQUATE PLASMA TREATMENT OR CONTAMINATION WAS PRESENT DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS, SUCH THAT THE SHAFT SEPARATED AT THE LAP JOINT. SINCE IT APPEARS THAT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE LAP JOINT SEPARATION MAY BE RELATED TO THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS, A FIELD DISCREPANCY NOTICE HAS BEEN ISSUED FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION. THIS MDR IS CONSIDERED CLOSED BY THE PRODUCT PERFORMANCE GROUP.",

THE COMPLAINT TEXT INDICATES THAT DISCREPANT CMV IGM RESULTS WERE GENERATED ON ONE PATIENT USING AN ARCHITECT I1000SR ANALYZER. THE FOLLOWING SAMPLE RESULTS: DATE: (B)(6) 2009, CMV IGM RESULT: POSITIVE, ANALYZER NAME: VIDAS; (B)(6) 2009, POSITIVE, VIDAS; (B)(6) 2009, POSITIVE, I1000SR; (B)(6) 2009, NEGATIVE, I1000SR. AFTER THE NEGATIVE CMV IGM RESULT GENERATED ON THE ARCHITECT I1000SR ANALYZER, THE CUSTOMER ANALYZED SERUM FROM THE SAMPLES COLLECTED IN (B)(6) AND WHEN ANALYZED ON THE I1000SR ANALYZER, THE RESULTS WERE NEGATIVE. THE CUSTOMER SUPPORT CENTER (CSC) INSTRUCTED THE CUSTOMER TO EXAMINE THE MESSAGE HISTORY LOG AND THE CUSTOMER STATED THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE INSTANCES OF ERROR CODES 3000 AND 3350 WHILE ANALYZING SAMPLES. THE CUSTOMER REPLACED THE PIPETTOR PROBE ON (B)(4) 2009. THE CUSTOMER RETURNED QUESTIONNAIRE DOCUMENTS OF THE CMV IG-M AND CMV IGG REAGENT AND CALIBRATOR LOT NUMBERS AND EXPIRATION DATES IN USE AT THE TIME OF THE CUSTOMER REPORTED ISSUE. ALSO, THE CONTROL VALUES FROM (B)(6) 2009 ARE INCLUDED. IN THE CUSTOMER RETURNED QUESTIONNAIRE, THE DATE OF THE CMV IGM CALIBRATORS IS LISTED AS (B)(6) 2009, AND UPON FURTHER COMMUNICATION WITH THE COUNTRY, THE DATE OF EXPIRATION IS AUGUST 03, 2009 AND THAT AFTER A REPEATABILITY TEST OF THE QC, THE INSTRUMENT HAS BEEN CONFIRMED TO BE OPERATING ACCORDING TO SPECIFICATIONS. A QUERY OF THE ABBOTT DATABASE WAS PERFORMED. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF OCCURRENCES OF INCONSISTENT, ERRATIC, AND ABERRANT RESULTS DUE TO INSTRUMENT AND/OR OPERATOR ISSUES WAS DETERMINED TO BE (B)(4). THE CURRENT COMBINED ERRATIC RESULT RATE FOR ARCHITECT I1000SR, I2000, AND I2000SR FALLS BELOW THE ESTABLISHED INTERNAL ABERRANT RESULT RATES AT PRODUCT LAUNCH. ARCHITECT SYSTEM OPERATIONS MANUAL (PN 201837-105) MAY, 2008 SECTION 10 TROUBLESHOOTING AND DIAGNOSTICS: FLUIDIC SUBSYSTEMS: FLUIDIC SUBSYSTEMS ARE THE HARDWARE COMPONENTS THAT CONTROL THE PRECISION AND ACCURACY OF LIQUID LEVEL SENSING, ASPIRATION, AND DISPENSE. ADDITIONALLY, THESE COMPONENTS DISTRIBUTE THE FLUIDS USED TO WASH THE PROBES. EXAMPLES: PIPETTORS, PROBES, LLS (LIQUID LEVEL SENSE) ANTENNAE, SYRINGES AND VALVES, DISPENSERS, TUBING, PUMPS, PROCESSING MODULE CIRCUIT BOARDS, AND WAM (WASH ASPIRATE MONITOR) THERMISTORS. SYMPTOMS: LIQUID LEVEL SENSE ERROR MESSAGES (3000-3999), IMPRECISE RESULTS, AND/OR ERRATIC RESULTS. SECTION 10 TROUBLESHOOTING AND DIAGNOSTICS LISTS THE PROBABLE CAUSES AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS FOR ERRATIC ASSAY RESULTS (I SYSTEM). PROBABLE CAUSES LISTED INCLUDE PROBE TIP IS BENT OR DAMAGED, PIPETTOR PROBES ARE NOT STRAIGHT AND PROBE IS NOT POSITIONED CORRECTLY. THE CORRESPONDING CORRECTIVE ACTIONS ARE ALSO LISTED. SECTION 10 TROUBLESHOOTING AND DIAGNOSTICS LISTS THE PROBABLE CAUSES AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS FOR ERROR CODE 3000. PROBABLE CAUSES LISTED INCLUDE PROBE IS OUT OF ALIGNMENT, PROBE IS DAMAGED, LIQUID LEVEL SENSE AND Z CABLE HAS A POOR CONNECTION AND PIPETTOR PROBE CLAMP IS LOOSE. THE CORRESPONDING CORRECTIVE ACTIONS ARE ALSO LISTED. SECTION 10 TROUBLESHOOTING AND DIAGNOSTICS LISTS THE PROBABLE CAUSES AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS FOR ERROR CODE 3350. PROBABLE CAUSES LISTED INCLUDE PIPETTOR PROBE CLIP IS LOOSE, PROBE IS OUT OF ALIGNMENT AND PROBE IS DAMAGED. THE CORRESPONDING CORRECTIVE ACTIONS ARE ALSO LISTED. ARCHITECT CMV IGM PACKAGE INSERT (56-7560/R1): LIMITATIONS OF PROCEDURE: IF THE ARCHITECT CMV IGM RESULTS ARE INCONSISTENT WITH CLINICAL EVIDENCE, ADDITIONAL TESTING IS SUGGESTED TO CONFIRM THE RESULT. FOR DIAGNOSTIC PURPOSES, RESULTS SHOULD BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER DATA; E.G., RESULTS OF OTHER TESTS (CMV IGG, CMV IGG AVIDITY), CLINICAL IMPRESSIONS, ETC. BASED UPON THE DATA AVAILABLE, AND THE RESULTS OF THIS INVESTIGATION, THE CAUSE OF THE CUSTOMER'S ISSUE WAS NOT IDENTIFIED, NOR WAS ANY DEFICIENCY IDENTIFIED. THIS IS THE FINAL REPORT.",

THE DEVICE MANUFACTURE DATE IS EITHER 11/05/2009 OR 01/25/2010. EVALUATION: WE COULD NOT CONFIRM THE REPORT BECAUSE THE PRODUCT SAID TO BE INVOLVED WAS NOT RETURNED TO COOK ENDOSCOPY FOR EVALUATION. THE POSSIBLE LOT NUMBERS OF THE PRODUCT SAID TO BE INVOLVED WERE USED TO REVIEW THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORDS. AFTER A REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORDS FOR THE POSSIBLE LOTS, WE CAN REPORT NO DISCREPANCIES OR ANOMALIES WERE NOTED. WE COULD NOT CONDUCT A SAMPLE TEST FROM THESE LOTS BECAUSE NONE OF THE PRODUCT FROM THIS LOT REMAINED IN FINISHED GOODS INVENTORY. A REVIEW OF THE TWELVE MONTH COMPLAINT HISTORY FOR THIS PRODUCT FAMILY WAS CONDUCTED. BASED ON THIS REVIEW, THE LIKELIHOOD OF THIS TYPE OF REPORT IS RARE. CONCLUSIONS: THE INFORMATION PROVIDED INDICATED THE SMALL BLUE HOOK OF THE LOADING CATHETER WAS PLACED NEAR THE KNOT ON THE TRIGGER CORD. THIS IS AGAINST THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE AND IS LIKELY RELATED TO THE REPORTED OBSERVATION OF HOOK SEPARATION FROM THE LOADING CATHETER. THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE DIRECT THE USER TO LEAVE APPROXIMATELY 2CM OF THE TRIGGER CORD BETWEEN THE KNOT ON THE TRIGGER CORD AND THE BLUE HOOK ON THE LOADING CATHETER DURING THE LOADING PROCESS. IF THE TRIGGER CORD IS ATTACHED TO THE BLUE HOOK WITH THE KNOT BESIDE THE BLUE HOOK, THIS COULD CREATE RESISTANCE WHEN WITHDRAWING THE LOADING CATHETER THROUGH THE LIGATOR HANDLE. IF ADDITIONAL PRESSURE IS APPLIED TO THE LOADING CATHETER WHEN RESISTANCE IS ENCOUNTERED, THIS CAN CAUSE SEPARATION OF THE BLUE HOOK FROM THE LOADING CATHETER. PRIOR TO DISTRIBUTION, ALL 6 SHOOTER SAEED MULTI-BAND LIGATORS ARE SUBJECTED TO A VISUAL INSPECTION TO ENSURE DEVICE INTEGRITY. A REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORDS CONFIRMED THAT THE POSSIBLE LOTS OF THE PRODUCT SAID TO BE INVOLVED MET ALL MANUFACTURING REQUIREMENTS PRIOR TO SHIPMENT. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: A CORRECTIVE ACTION HAS BEEN INITIATED IN AN EFFORT TO REDUCE OCCURRENCES OF LOADING CATHETER HOOK SEPARATION. THIS PRODUCT WAS MANUFACTURED PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS CORRECTIVE ACTION. NO FURTHER ACTION WARRANTED AT THIS TIME BECAUSE THE INFORMATION PROVIDED INDICATED THE BLUE HOOK WAS PLACED NEAR THE TRIGGER CORD HOOK, WHICH IS AGAINST THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE AND IS LIKELY RELATED TO THE REPORTED OBSERVATION. THE LIKELIHOOD OF THIS TYPE OF OCCURRENCE IS RARE. CUSTOMER QUALITY ASSURANCE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR FOR COMPLAINT TRENDS.",

EVALUATION, METHOD: OTHER: MICROBIAL TESTING OF OPENED/UNOPENED REAGENTS AND RETENTION LOTS. EVALUATION, RESULTS: OTHER: WBC REAGENT PART A, (B)(4), LOTS 51749I2, 51754I2, AND 56675I2. PMA/510(K) NUMBER: THERE IS NO 510(K) NUMBER FOR CELL-DYN WBC REAGENT A. THE 510(K) FILED WITH THE INITIAL MEDWATCH REFLECTS THE CELL-DYN 4000 ANALYZER. THE CELL-DYN 4000 AND CELL-DYN SAPPHIRE ANALYZERS WERE EXPERIENCING ELEVATED WBC BACKGROUND COUNTS IN THE FIELD. BACKGROUND COUNTS WERE RECOVERING UP TO 0.5 X 103/UL .THE SPECIFICATION FOR WBC BACKGROUND READINGS IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 0.10 X 103/UL PER THE CELL-DYN SAPPHIRE OPERATOR'S MANUAL, (B)(4), REVISION D AND CELL-DYN 4000 SYSTEM OPERATOR'S MANUAL, (B)(4), REVISION M. BACKGROUNDS COUNTS MUST BE WITHIN SPECIFICATION PRIOR TO REPORTING OF PATIENT SAMPLES. IF THE OPERATOR PROCEEDS TO RUN PATIENT SAMPLES WITH BACKGROUND COUNTS OUT OF SPECIFICATION, RESULTS MAY EXHIBIT FLUORESCENT PARTICLE FLAGGING, FLUORESCENT CHANNEL 3 FLAGS, RESISTANT RBC FLAGS, INCREASED NUCLEATED RBC FLAGS OR ABNORMAL WBC HISTOGRAM SCATTER PLOTS. IF PRODUCT LABELING IS NOT FOLLOWED AND PATIENT RESULTS ARE REPORTED, WBC RESULTS MAY BE INACCURATE AND HIGHER THAN ACTUAL RESULTS; HOWEVER, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT PATIENT MANAGEMENT WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. INVESTIGATION OF THIS ISSUE DETECTED MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION IN THE WBC REAGENT PART A, (B)(4), WHICH IS DISTRIBUTED FOR USE WITH THE CELL-DYN SAPPHIRE AND CELL-DYN 4000 INSTRUMENTS. THE MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION WAS IDENTIFIED ONLY ON LOTS 51749I2, 51754I2, AND 56675I2 OF WBC REAGENT PART A, (B)(4). THE CONTAMINANT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED TO BE PSEUDOMONAS SPECIES, AN ENVIRONMENTAL ISOLATE COMMON IN BIO-FILMS, AND DOES NOT PRESENT A SAFETY HAZARD. THE MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION, SPORADIC IN NATURE, CAN AFFECT OTHER LOTS OF WBC REAGENT PART A, AS MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION WITHIN THE WBC REAGENT PART A CAN FURTHER CONTAMINATE THE CELL-DYN SAPPHIRE AND CELL-DYN 4000 SYSTEMS. THE SOURCE OF THE MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION WAS DETERMINED TO BE CAUSED BY A COMBINATION OF FACTORS, INCLUDING LACK OF FILTRATION OF WATER USED FOR CLEANING PROCEDURES, BIOFILM SHEDDING IN THE FILL LINE, INCREASED BIOBURDEN DUE TO STAGNANT ZONES IN THE FILL-LINE AREA AND FAILURE TO ACCURATELY DETECT CONTAMINATION AS PART OF PRODUCT RELEASE. THE FOLLOWING CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WERE PUT IN PLACE IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION: ALL THREE AFFECTED LOTS WERE RECALLED FROM THE FIELD AND CUSTOMERS WERE INSTRUCTED TO DECONTAMINATE THEIR INSTRUMENTS PRIOR TO USING ANY NEW WBC REAGENT PART A. INCORPORATION OF AN IMPROVED MICROBIAL TESTING METHOD INTO THE CURRENT PROCESS. INCREASED FREQUENCY OF SANITIZATION IN THE FILL-LINE AREA, INCLUDING FILTRATION OF THE WATER USED FOR CLEANING-IN-PLACE PROCEDURES. INCREASED FLUSHING OF THE FILL-LINE EQUIPMENT AND AUTOCLAVING OF FILL-LINE COMPONENTS, SUCH AS NOZZLES. COMPLETION OF THE FINAL CORRECTIVE ACTIONS HAS BEEN TARGETED FOR THE END OF (B)(6) 2008. BASED ON THE INVESTIGATION FINDINGS, THE MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED ONLY IN WBC PART A REAGENT, (B)(4), FOR LOTS 51749I2, 51754I2 AND 56675I2; HOWEVER, IF THE INSTRUMENT IS NOT PROPERLY DECONTAMINATED, THE CONTAMINATED WBC REAGENT PART A HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SPREAD TO THE CELL-DYN SAPPHIRE AND CELL-DYN 4000 INSTRUMENTS AND CAN THEN BACK-CONTAMINATE OTHER BOTTLES OF WBC REAGENT PART A PLACED ON THE CONTAMINATED INSTRUMENT.

PT STARTED ON ASSISTED PT TRIGGERED MODE OF VENTILATION. DUE TO WORSENING CONDITION CLINICAL DECISION MADE TO USE OSCILLATING VENTILATION. WORKED WELL FOR OVER 6HR ALTHOUGH PT CONDITION HAD NOT IMPROVED. OSCILLATOR STARTED TO MAKE A LOUD WHISTLING NOISE. USERS CONFIRMED THIS TO BE THE GAS FAILURE ALARM. USERS OBSERVED THE OSCILLATOR WAS STILL WORKING DURING THIS ALARM. WHILST STILL OSCILLATING THE PT VARIOUS CHECKS MADE TO DETERMINE CAUSE DECISION 0.5HR DECISION MADE TO REPLACE THE OSCILLATOR.\" \" ON INITIAL INVESTIGATION BY ON CALL ENGINEER IT WAS CONFIRMED THE NOISE WAS THE GAS FAIL ALARM. THE FOLLOWING CONFIRMED IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT THE BLENDER USED ON THIS EQUIPMENT WHICH HOUSES THE GAS FAIL ALARM WHISTLE WAS FAULTY. OUR RECORDS SHOW THIS BLENDER WAS RECENTLY SUPPLIED AS A SERVICE EXCHANGE AND THIS WAS PROBABLY THE FIRST TIME IT WAS USED ON A PT. (NEXT SERVICE DATE AUG 2009). VIASYS WERE CONTACTED AND THEY ATTENDED. THEY ALSO CONFIRMED THE CAUSE OF THE WHISTLE WAS DUE TO THE GAST FAIL ALARM ALTHOUGH THE BLENDER IS ACTUALLY STILL DELIVERING THE CORRECT LEVEL OF OXYGEN. BLENDER HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN AND HELD IN QUARANTINE.\" THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL INFO CONCERNING THE EVENT AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE PT'S DEATH WAS COPIED FROM AN E-MAIL FROM THE USER FACILITY THAT WAS IN RESPONSE TO A LETTER SENT BY CARDINAL HEALTH SEEKING ADDITIONAL INFO. \"PT HAD BEEN ON SENSOR MEDICS HFOV SINCE 2007. THE VENTILATOR WAS FUNCTIONING NORMALLY. AT 18:30, CONTINUOUS ALARM BEGAN. NO ALARM LIGHTS ON THE VENTILATOR ILLUMINATED. POWER SUPPLY, AND GAS TUBING WAS ALL CHECKED AND FOUND INTACT. THERE WAS NO OBSERVED CHANGE IN THE PT'S CONDITION (PT WAS EXTREMELY SICK - SEE BELOW). OUR IMPRESSION WAS THAT DESPITE THE PERSISTENT ALARM THE VENTILATOR WAS FUNCTIONING NORMALLY. IT WAS UNCLEAR AT THE TIME WHAT CAUSED THE ALARM.\" \"PT WAS EXTREMELY PRETERM BABY (25 WEEKS GESTATION. SHE HAD BEEN REASONABLY STABLE UNTIL THE PREVIOUS NIGHT WHEN SHE DETERIORATED DUE TO A PULMONARY HAEMORRHAGE AND THEREAFTER NEEDED INTENSIVE SUPPORT INCLUDING HFOV WITH FIO2 100%, INOTROPIC SUPPORT, BICARBONATE INFUSION AND BLOOD PRODUCTS. SHE HAD STABILIZED TO AN EXTENT ON HFOV BUT HAD BEGUN TO DETERIORATE AGAIN ABOUT TWO HOURS PRIOR TO THE SAID \"ALARM.\" \"AS INDICATED THE PT'S CONDITION DID NOT CHANGE IN PARALLEL TO THE ALARM. NO OTHER HFO WAS IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE. ATTEMPTS TO VENTILATE MANUALLY (NEOPUFF) 7 A BRIEF TRAIL OF CONVENTIONAL VENTILATION RESULTED IN LOWER SATURATIONS THAN PREVIOUSLY. AN HFO WAS TRANSFERRED FROM ANOTHER PT (WHO WAS ABLE TO MANAGE ON CONVENTIONAL VENTILATION) AND HFO WAS CONTINUED. THE PT'S GENERAL CONDITION CONTINUED TO DETERIORATE WITH NO IMPROVEMENT IN OXYGENATION AND VENTILATION, AND A PERSISTENT AND WORSENING METABOLIC ACIDOSIS REFRACTORY TO BICARBONATE INFUSION. THE PT DIED ABOUT 8 HOURS LATER. IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE ALARM FAILURE MADE ANY CONTRIBUTION TO THE PT'S DEATH.\"",
